    "## Why causal inference and not machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses, enterprises, and industries often face questions of cause and effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does offering my customers a discount change their purchase behavior?\n",
    "- How does tweaking this one variable in my manufacturing process change the quality of my product?\n",
    "- How does altering this one mechanical piece change the overall behavior of my machinery?\n",
    "- How does addressing my customers via e-mail or through a planned marketing campaign change their willingness to buy my product?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these planned interventions or manipulation of your business, your pricing policy,\n",
    "manufacturing process, or your complex machinery changes the way the process of interest changes\n",
    "because you change the data generation mechanism by placing in a new regime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking in terms of these business interventions and how they affect your operations is a natural process in all businesses, enterprises, and industries.\n",
    "However, our common toolset of descriptive and predictive data analytics (machine learning) does, in most instances, not provide useful answers to these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "While machine learning methodologies are uniquely geared towards uncovering patterns in your observed data, they are limited to already observed patterns in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you haven't yet tested the effects of that 10% discount on your sales, change in raw materials on your product's quality, or increase in stifness of that one spring on your machinery's vibrations then machine learning\n",
    "won't be able to tell you."
